//attendantly i implied about @FCE365 (GeoSn0w) having part involved with 10.3-10.3.1 kernels.
the exploit i intended to do as is, i used his exploit temporary to have an idea and use as a template so i can accurately
measure all perimeters for my learning experience.
I now, (iBootBeta2) commit to not imply any accused information told as false. It intended to be an accident, i hadn't taken any notice to it until GeoSn0w himself told me.
I apologize for my sins.
Becoming an expert throughout coding is hard. Yes, i stuffed up pretty badly, letting down many of his community, i'm very sorry, and this will not become an issue again.
I've never in my life had this chance ever! my life wasn't the best, but... Coding came to my heart and never left me ever since.
--This i promise to GeoSn0w, that if he ever had come across an issue as considered not crediting for your piece, i'll remove this repository.--
CREDIT TO HIM!
