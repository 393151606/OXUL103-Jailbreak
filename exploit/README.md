the exploit had been removed by me. GeoSn0w hadn't approved that i "imply he made an exploit due for 10.3" which is bull----
i never said that, and now he makes a video, about this!? Grow up and become a man, not some 20y/o on his computer 24/7 picking out small developers and causing beef!
NO WONDER QWERTYORUIOP HAS BEEF WITH YOU!
Just because you can't get off your lazy a-- to compile your own Jailbreak. 
Then you'll bi--h about "But you falsely accused me creating an exploit for 10.3x"
Gr0w a pair of balls and quit your yapping.
You expose everyone for their tiny mistakes, even when they promise to recheck and fix, you'll pick up on that mistake and turn it into like it's a big problem.
You're just salty! and now you're going to make a video about this too? what a salty child.
Your excuse of not getting up off of your couch is "i'm learning advanced iOS code" Biggest bullshit ever.
